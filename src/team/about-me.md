title: About Me
bio: >-
  My name is Eric Smith and I am a front end web developer. I enjoy designing,
  planning, and building web applications. Between experiences from work and
  school I am able to take problems and turn them into solution using software.
  When Iâ€™m not writing code, I enjoy snowboarding and hitting breweries with
  friends.
